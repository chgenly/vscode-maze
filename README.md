# Maze README

A Visual Studio Code extension to generate and solve mazes.  This was written as a project to learn the VS Code environment.

In the command pallete 

>  maze: generate 

and 

>  maze: solve

The extension contains the maze generation and solution routines. The web view handles drawing the maze.  The division is somewhat
arbitrary, it was divided this way to let me use postMessage.
